Thanks to all who jumped in on a call last night to ask questions about the W6 project.  Thought I'd share a bit more about my tools & workflow when doing these reports in case it helps anyone else!

### Tools:
Google Docs
make sure to use the built in table of contents feature to save time & create good looking ToC's
use the built in Citation system to collect your citations & populate a reference section

### My report images:
ChatGPT
I'll use  GIMP image editor to remove backgrounds, remove some of the other  clutter & fix spelling issues that ChatGPT creates

### Flowcharts & Diagrams:
Miro (flowcharts)
Canva (diagrams)

### Presentations:
Google Slides with templates from SlidesGo

### My Report template:
I hacked the current one I use together with some chatGPT images (of cryptographic-like text) for the footer graphic and top corner.  Idea came simply from existing Google Doc templates.

### Other tools:
Notion (I'll create a task list for the project & just mark off things as I complete them & can use it for assembling any other research too)
ChatGPT / LarryAI - I'll usually copy & paste the project description and ask it to rewrite it just so I can get a different perspective on what the project page is asking (like many of you, I find these project descriptions confusing).

### Working in Google Docs:
since I've got a template that I like for now, I'll just copy it from one project to another - erasing the bulk of it (aside from what I might re-use) & starting a new outline for the current project (based on the task list I create & the expected outcome of the project).
As I start cobbling together report details, I'll add in placeholders & some of my notes/research material until it gets re-written.
Stuff I need to fill in, I'll highlight things to return to.

Hope that helps!
