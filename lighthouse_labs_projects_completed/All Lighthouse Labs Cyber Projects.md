üë®‚Äçüíª As a web and application developer, I have a strong interest in AppSec (Applicaton Security) and cybersecurity in general. I have experience with various tools and technologies used in this field, including Kali Linux, Wireshark, Nmap, and more. I am also familiar with common security vulnerabilities and best practices for securing web applications.

üñ•Ô∏è I also designed and implemented an extensive home lab environment with multiple servers that also span different provinces and connect via secure VPNs. I have experience with setting up and configuring various types of servers, including web servers, database servers, and more. Some of this server space is rented out for a Canadian civil engineering company who utilizes it for their business on a day to day basis, and some space is rented out for business and private user off-site backup storage solutions.
