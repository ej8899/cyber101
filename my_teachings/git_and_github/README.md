# Git and GitHub - and Introduction

Git is a widely used source control management (SCM) tool, suitable for projects of any size and adaptable to various types of content - from programming source code to simple text files (like this one).

Unlike some other SCM tools, Git operates in a distributed manner, meaning there is no single central code repository. This characteristic has made Git especially popular in the development of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). The decentralized nature of Git contributes to its resilience, minimizing the risk of a single point of failure and helping to ensure that FOSS libraries remain accessible and free.

GitHub is a web-based platform built on top of Git, designed to facilitate collaboration and sharing within development teams. It provides a centralized place to host your Git repositories, along with powerful tools for version control, issue tracking, and project management. GitHub also fosters a vibrant community where developers can contribute to open-source projects, showcase their work, and collaborate on code from anywhere in the world. In this guide, you'll learn how to leverage GitHub alongside Git to manage your projects more effectively and collaborate with others.

This introductory guide to Git and GitHub will provide you with the essential knowledge to set up a project and take 'snapshots' of your progress, all while allowing others to collaborate with you.
